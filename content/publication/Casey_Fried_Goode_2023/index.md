abstract: "We use theory and empirics to distinguish between the impact of tempera-
ture on transition (temporary) and steady state (permanent) growth in output
per capita. Standard economic theory suggests that the long-run growth rate
of output per capita is determined entirely by the growth rate of total factor
productivity (TFP). We find evidence suggesting that the level of temperature
affects the level of TFP, but not the growth rate of TFP. This implies that
a change in temperature will have a temporary impact on growth in output
per capita. To highlight the quantitative importance of distinguishing between
permanent and temporary changes in economic growth, we use our empirical
estimates and theoretical framework to project the impacts of future increases
in temperature caused by climate change. We find losses that are substan-
tial, but smaller than those in the existing empirical literature that assumes a
change in temperature permanently affects economic growth."
